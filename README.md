## Introduction

LearnMore is a fully functional ed-tech platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). It facilitates the creation, consumption, and rating of educational content, providing a seamless and interactive learning experience for students and a platform for instructors to connect with learners globally.

## System Architecture

### Front-end

The front-end is built using ReactJS, creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces for an engaging learning experience. It communicates with the back-end through RESTful API calls.

### Back-end

The back-end, built with NodeJS and ExpressJS, provides APIs for user authentication, course management, and content processing. MongoDB serves as the flexible and scalable database.

### API Design

The API follows RESTful principles, implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses JSON for data exchange and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Deployment

LearnMore is deployed on various cloud-based services:
- Front-end: Vercel
- Back-end: Render or Railway
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Media files: Cloudinary
